## \#\# Setup and Installation üöÄ

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * `pip` (Python package installer)
  * A code editor (like VS Code)

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd banka-project
```

### 2\. Backend Setup (Django)

First, set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, install the required packages and set up the database.

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# (Optional) Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start the backend development server
python manage.py runserver
```

The backend API will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 3\. Frontend Access

The frontend consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Since Django is configured to serve these files, you can access the application by navigating to the following URLs in your browser:

  * **Homepage**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
  * **Sign In**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/signin/`
